errors and mistakes within this project

Submissions Page
I am unsure whether I have correctly added add submission function. It will add one picture with title and accept the other URL for additional images but as I will cover in the next issue I am unable to determine whether it will function on the details page.

Details page
This page functions as intended with it being able to read the object array and repurpose the information into a html/css display however it wont display the information given by additional submissions and I am unsure how to fix this. I researched online and tried many things but I feel there is something I have over complicated or simply missed to fix this error

secondly the additonal task of getting the next and previous to button to cycle through the images was unsuccessful, I found a way to add a counter which functions with formentioend buttons but was unable to find a way to link that to the array. Again I fear that all examples found were very overcompliated and not suited to the use I intended. \ I am fully aware the task was set to challenge us and our abilty to research but perhaps in future it would benefical to suggest a website or research tool in which some answers for this can be found as I for one found it extremley frustring trying to navigate through dozens of other peoples methods.

My attempts included including a for loop within the counter to count through the array and change the image with each click which I could'nt get to work 

Also attempted to use several searched code methods of changing the opacity of the images to rotate which was visable at once.

I will resolve this error on my submissions in the coming week however in a office hours as It is something that has troubled me greastly over the last week and would very much like to know how close or far off I was.
